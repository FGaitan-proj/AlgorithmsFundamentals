  <strong> Graph Algorithms </strong>

      <li><strong><a href="breadth.html">BreadthFirstSearch</a></strong></li>
      <li>Breadth First Search is a graph search algorithm that first
        examines the root. It then examines the child nodes of that root,
        saving each examined child nodes for the next series of searches.
        Then the first child's child nodes will be examines and saved, and
        this process will continue until the node is found or we examine
        each node. It is also important to note that it does not repeat
        nodes. </li> <p></p>
      <li><strong><a href="breadth.html">DepthFirstSearch</a></strong></li>
      <li>Depth First Search is a graph search algorithm that first
        examines the root. It then examines a singe child nodes of that root,
        then searches a single child of that node, and it continues this process 
        until it reaches a leaf. It will then search the other children. It is
        also important to note that it does not repeat nodes. </li> <p></p>

  <strong> Array Algorithms</strong>
  <nav>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
      <li><a href="binary.html"><strong>BinarySearch</strong></a></li>
      <li>Binary Search is an array searching algorithm that examines
        the element in the mid position, then in the first half, then 
        in the second half, and so on. Until the array is completely 
        sorted. </li> <p></p>
      <li><a href="quick.html"><strong>QuickSort</strong></a></li>
      <li>Quick Sort is an array sorting algorithm that uses two helper 
        functions. The first helper takes a pivot and verifies elements 
        in the beginning are less than the pivot and elements in the 
        end have value greater than the pivot, and if either of these 
        statements are false, then it will swap the elements. Once, the 
        entire array is compared, it will return the position of the 
        final swap. The other helper function then takes this position 
        and does a recursive call on the array from the beginning to 
        this position and another from this position to the end of the 
        array. This sorts the entire array. </li> <p></p>
      <li><a href="merge.html"><strong>MergeSort</strong></a></li> 
      <li>Merge Sort is an array sorting algorithm that makes two recursive 
        calls the first half and second half of the array. Then compares 
        the first element of both sorted halves, and the smallest element
        gets placed into the first position. The other element gets 
        compared with the next element in the half with the smaller element. 
        This process goes on until either or both halves have been copied 
        into the new array. Then the algorithm places any elements left 
        at the end of the array.
